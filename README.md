# PythonDataStructures
This repo is an implementation of the various algorithms in python using python data structures
## BUBBLE SORT
-The implementation for bubble sort is provided in bubblesort.py where a list is sorted in accordance to ascending order.<br /><br />
-Similary bubble_sort.py implements the bubble sort algorithm where the dictionary elements are sorted on the basis of their key values.<br /><br />
-Various methods are implemented in order to reduce the space complexity and time complexity of the algorithms.The inclusion of the swapped variable is one of the methods.<br /><br />
-The swapped variable does'nt run the loop if the elements in the list are already swapped.or the if condition is not executed.<br /><br />

## BINARY SEARCH TREE 
-Binary search Tree consist of Binary Search tree class,add_child node and search node for searching data.<br /><br />
-The in-order traversal is shown in the module binarytree.py<br /><br />
-To read about Inorder traversal go to 
binarytree <br /><br />
- The pre-order traversal is shown in the module binarytreecopy.py<br /><br />
- The post-order traversal is shown in the module binarytreecopy.py<br /><br />
-The minimum value of the tree is shown in the module binarytreecopy.py<br /><br />
-The maximum value of the tree is shown in the module binarytreecopy.py<br /><br />

## LINKED LIST
- A linked list solves the various time and space complexities associated with the lists
- A linked list contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node
- A linked list is efficient in solving the memory and the various issues associated with the normal list
- The comparison table for this is :</br></br>
|                                  | Array           | Linked List |
| ---------------------------------| ----------------| ------------|
| Indexing                         | O(1)            | O(n)        | 
| Insert/Delete Elements at Start  | O(n)            | O(1)        |
| Insert/Delete Elements at End    | O(1)-amortized  | O(n)        |
| Insert Element in Middle         | O(n)            | O(n)        |
