# PythonDataStructures
This repo is an implementation of the various algorithms in python using python data structures
## BUBBLE SORT\\
The implementation for bubble sort is provided in bubblesort.py where a list is sorted in accordance to ascending order.
\\ Similary bubble_sort.py implements the bubble sort algorithm where the dictionary elements are sorted on the basis of their key values.
\\  Various methods are implemented in order to reduce the space complexity and time complexity of the algorithms.The inclusion of the swapped variable is one of the methods.
\\ The swapped variable does'nt run the loop if the elements in the list are already swapped.or the if condition is not executed.
## INFO
\\ This contains various necessary information and practices for coding.
