Set is an important data structure available in Java and Python.
It removes the duplicate elements from the list
Internally to implement set we can use Binary Search Tree
Binary Tree is a regular Tree with a constraint that it has at least two child nodes
AT max=2
Binary Search Tree
-The elements to the left are always less than the root element 
-The elements to the right are always more than the root element 
-This applies to every node 
-Elements are always unique

The search complexity is always reduced to half because when we add an element to the left or right we are reducing the search factor by half 

Search Complexity : O(logn)

Breadth First Search 
Depth First Search 
- In order Traversal 
- Pre Order Traversal 
- Post Order Traversal
